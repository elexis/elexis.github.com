GitHub pages for the elexis web site. See the readme from the master branch: https://github.com/elexis/elexis.github.com/blob/master/de/readme.md

# Publishing

As the github pages do not allow us to use a multilingual jekyll we are hosting our own jekyll on services.elexis.info.

The services it intergrated as a systemd service. See /etc/systemd/system/jekyll.service.

After pushing changes do not forget to pull them in /home/srv/elexis.info on services.elexis.info.
