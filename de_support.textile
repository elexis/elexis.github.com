"Medelexis AG":http://www.medelexis.ch offers commercial support for medical practices in the German speaking part of Switzerland. It has also developped some proprietary plug-ins and has invested much time, effort and money to squash all bugs out of Elexis.

We know of the following companies offering help in developing new plug-ins and/or improving existing features of Elexis:
* "Medelexis AG":http://www.medelexis.ch
* "Medevit":http://www.medevit.at
* "MedShare GmbH":http://www.medshare.ch
* "Hilotec":http://www.hilotec.com

Besides Medelexis there are several other swiss german companies offering support for installing and administrating Elexis (either plain OpenSource or the Medelexis variant) in medical practices.

If you wish to add your company and have a proven track record, the maintainers of this site will be pleased to add you here, too.
