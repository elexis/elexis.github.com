h2(#what).  What is Elexis?

Elexis is an Eclipse RCP program for all aspects of a medical practice: electronic medical record (EMR), laboratory findings etc., as well as accounting, billing (swiss TARMED-System, other systems to be developped) and other daily work.

A fully functional version (including only a small set of plug-ins in order not to confuse newcomers) may be downloaded via the "Files" tab. Users may optionally include a demo database to have a playground for experiments. 

The "Elexis Forum":http://elexis-forum.ch/ is the place where (Swiss-German) users share their experiences.

The site http://www.elexis.ch contains a lot of (sometimes outdated) information as it is not actively maintained.

Developers and anybody trying to compile Elexis from scratch should look at "Elexis bootstrap project":https://bitbucket.org/ngiger/elexis-bootstrap
