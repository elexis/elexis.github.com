[Medelexis AG](http://www.medelexis.ch) offers commercial support for
medical practices in the German speaking part of Switzerland. It has
also developped some proprietary plug-ins and has invested much time,
effort and money to squash all bugs out of Elexis.

We know of the following companies offering help in developing new
plug-ins and/or improving existing features of Elexis:
* [Medelexis AG](http://www.medelexis.ch)
* [Medevit](http://www.medevit.at)
* [MedShare GmbH](http://www.medshare.ch)
* [Hilotec](http://www.hilotec.com)

Besides Medelexis there are several other swiss german companies
offering support for installing and administrating Elexis (either plain
OpenSource or the Medelexis variant) in medical practices.

If you wish to add your company and have a proven track record,
send an email to to maintainer of this webpage [Niklaus Giger](mailto:niklaus.giger@member.fsf.org)
